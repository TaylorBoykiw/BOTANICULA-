			<p>Botanicula was a point-and-click exploration game created by Amanita Design, on april 12, 2012. It it the story of five characters inspired by botanical characteristics of plants, who are trying to defend their home tree from the fungus spiders. There is multiple puzzels throughout the game adding onto the ongoing complexity of the full game because each puzzel has its own intricate story within it. The soundtrack is even very intricate and unique that has alot of complex sounds from insects, animals, and the weather; sounds that have been known to relax and also stimulate the brain! This madeup world is filled with vast amounts of mystery and wonder which is probably why it got 5/5 on Steam and 4.7/5 from the Apple App Store. If you ever want to put the time into playing a very high quality mobile game, Botanicula is the way to go!  </p>
