			<p>The gameplay is based on a point-and-click style that Amanita Design is famous for. </p>
			
			<img src="gameplay2.gif" width="600px">
			
			<p> The objective is to save your home tree from the fungus spiders, kinda scary right?</p>
			
			<img src="gameplay3.webp" width="600px">
			
			<p>To save your home tree, you must complete multiple puzzels and quests for some of the inhabitants. These puzzels/quests are fairly personal to some of the inhabitants, revealing quite a bit about their lives and the world you live in!</p>
			
			<img src="gameplay4.webp" width="600px">
			
			<p> Sometimes the puzzels can be confusing and time consuming- but you shouldn't give up, focus on the overall story and how great it will be after you complete the puzzel</p>

			<p> Botanicula is a very quirky, charming little story that anyone can find the time to enjoy.
